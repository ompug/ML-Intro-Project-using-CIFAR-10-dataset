# ML-Intro-Project-using-CIFAR-10-dataset

This project taught me how to set up a CNN for the basic CIFAR-10 dataset, which has images of different everyday things like airplanes, cats, and dogs.

I learned how to:
- set up an ML environment involving the libraries:
	- tensorflow (keras)
	- numpy 
	- matplotlib
- load and preprocess training data
- visualize the data
- design CNN architecture via adding layers, flattening, outputting dense layers, and compiling
- train the model with validation split
- use early stopping and csv logger for keeping track
- plot train_accuracy vs validation_accuracy
- Evaluate the Model by generating Classification Report and Confusion Matrix

And biggest of all: *Make Accurate Predictions*
